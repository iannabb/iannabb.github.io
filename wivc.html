<h1>A Week in the Life of a VC</h1>
		<p>A lot of my friends, family, and management teams ask me what is a typical day as a venture investor. <br>The boilerplate answer of, "No day is a typical day" is true, but doesn't give the question justice. <br>So below is a sample of what a "typical" week might look like:</p>


		<ul>
			<li>Monday 
				<ol>
					<li>Monday Morning Meeting</li>
					<li>Management Presentation</li>
					<li>Portfolio Company Weekly Update</li></ol></li>
			<br>
			<li>Tuesday
				<ol>
					<li>Lunch with Potential Co-Investor</li>
					<li>Launch party for acquisition integration completion</li>
					<li>Working dinner with Portfolio Company CEO</li></ol></li>
			<br>
			<li>Wednesday
				<ol>
					<li>Work on financial model for live deal</li>
					<li>Conference</li>
					<li>Outline Letter of Intent for potential acquisition</li></ol></li>
			<br>
			
			<li>Thursday
				<ol>
					<li>Breakfast Event with CEO</li>
					<li>Call with Existing Investor to discuss potential investment</li>
					<li>Meeting to discuss balance sheet investment strategy with Portfolio Company CFO</li></ol></li>
			<br>		
			
			<li>Friday
				<ol>
					<li>Coffee with startup founder</li>
					<li>Give presentation to University of Maryland finance club</li>
					<li>Camden team building event to finish out the work week</li></ol></li>

					<br>
			
			<li>Weekend
				<ol>
					<li>Catch up on all the emails that have accumulated over the week</li>
					<li>Intro to front end developing class</li>
					<li>Relax and take a deep breath before starting all over again on Monday</li></ol></li>

		</ul>
